Future of Debate Me - Development: https://github.com/deco3500-2017/SuzukiSwifts/blob/master/Future%20of%20Debate%20Me.docx

# **Stand Up 1:**
## **Aims/Goals:** 
- Create low fidelity paper prototype of the user interface 
 - Create different versions of the options menu screen to see which is more appealing to users
 - Rating system screen
 - Online and inperson debate screens
 - est after finishing designing
- Develop a proforma test plan and questionnaire for users to test .
- Create personas to identify our target audience.
- Test our concept with users.


## **Progress:** 
- Created a low fidelity paper prototype for the apps user interface with a variation in designs. 
- Created a proforma test plan with questions to ask users.
- Created three personas.
- Completed the value proposition canvas for each persona.
- Conducted a questionnaire to test the concept of Debate Me.
- Completed the project proposal. 

## **Issues/Changes:** 
- Some participants of the user test had stated that debating could possibly cause some conflicts and dislike each other, instead of becoming friends. Therefore, we added 'discussion' mode, where the users can friendlily discuss about the topic, instead of arguing against each other. 
- Users were confused about the rating system. It was unclear what they were actually rating and therefore we decided to change this to a “Send a star” system where the users send a star only if they enjoyed debating with a matched partner. Number of stars received represent the level of that user in the app. 

## **Plan for next sprint:** 
- Run user tests:
- Debating Concept
- Menu screen
- Rating system 	
- Inperson debate (GPS navigation screen)
- Online debate screen
- Create digital prototype using marvel. 
- Develop proforma test plan. 
- Run user tests for the marvel prototype. 

## **Contributions:** 
Daiki:
- Completed the content of Value Proposition Canvas for each persona
- Contribution the project proposal
- Worked on completing the paper prototype during the meeting.
- Conducted user test using paper prototype with 3 users.
- Noted all the observations, as well as users' feedbacks.
- Written the analysis of the user tests and changed the concept based on the feedback received with the team. 
Completed stand up documentation with Rohnil


Rohnil: 
- Created proforma test plan
- Created  questions for the user tests
- Contribution to the project proposal:
- Project Idea
- Project Challenges
- User research analysis
- Worked on finishing the paper prototype during group meeting. 
- Completed stand up documentation with Daiki.

# **Stand Up 2:**
## **Aims/Goals:** 
- Design a more realistic digital prototype using marvel app. 
- Develop proforma test plans and questionnaires. 
- Run user tests for marvel app prototype:
- Debating Concept
- Menu screen
- Online debate timing system
- Rating system 	
- Inperson debate (GPS navigation screen)
- Online debate screen
- Create digital prototype using marvel. 
- Document test results and run analysis.
- Test chat functionality with the messenger app.


## **Progress:**  
- Created a digital prototype using Mavel.
- Created proforma test plan
- Ran user tests with the Marvel prototype. 
- We especially set our focus on the timing and rating system for the user tests. Instead of testing many users at once, we tested many times with few users and iteratively evaluated the results to further improve the project.
Used the Facebook messenger app as our chat functionality. One of the members pretended to be another user and played the app against the actual user.
- We tested each mode of the app, including '1vs1 Debate', 1vs1 Discuss', 'Group Debate' and 'Group Discuss'. 
- The user tests results clearly determined the most suitable time for the timing system. It was set to: 2minutes for the topic page, 30 seconds reading time to read and prepare for your own argument after receiving a message from the opponent, and 2 minutes typing time. 


## **Issues/Changes:**  
- From the observation of the user test, the team realised that the users are not connected after becoming friends through Debate Me. We added a 'Favourite' system where users can add people to their favourites page if they had a positive experience with the other user, while sending the star to that partner. When the user adds each other to the favourite list, they can contact each other through the app for future.
- The users were very confused with how to end the debate. The original idea was that if the user does not send a message within 2 minutes, the debate immediately ends. However, there was no indication for the users to be notified about how it exactly ends. Furthermore, many users disagreed with this idea and thus, based on the feedbacks, we decided to set a number of rounds. 
- After adding the rounds system, another user test was conducted to determine the most reasonable number of rounds. Majority of the users said that 3 rounds were perfect. 
- Group Debate was unsuccessful because taking turns with multiple users took too long and demotivated the users from debating. 
- Online Group Discuss was also unsuccessful because firstly, there was less interaction between the users and secondly, they often digressed from the topic. 

## **Plan for next sprint:**  
- Develop an external chat system for the Marvel app prototype which will be integrated with the existing prototype.. 
- Develop prompts for the in person debate function. 
- Conduct user tests with prompts. 
- Test external chat system. 

## **Contributions:** 
Daiki:
- Created the whole marvel app prototype, based on the paper prototype from the previous standup
- I have messaged the tutor and emailed the lecturer for further feedbacks and help to improve our project and make sure that our plan was on the right track because the mark we received for the previous stand up was poor.
- Conducted user test for the mode with other members.
- The user test for the mode with Jack and Rohnil
- The user test for the timing and rating system once with the whole team and once with Jack Lars and Rohnil.
- Conducted another user test for the number of rounds chat system by myself with 3 users. 
- Every time the team made a change to the concept, I modified the digital prototype.
- Also added all the improvements to the prototype.
- Completed stand up documentation with Rohnil


Rohnil: 
- Created proforma test plans for the timing and round system. 
- Created questionnaires for user tests for the timing and round system.
- Conducted a user test for the timing and rating system with Daiki and Jack.
- Conducted a second user test with adjustments made to the timing and rating system with Daiki, Jack and Lars. 
- Conducted third user test with the final changes made for the timing and rating system with the whole team. 
- Documented the user test results and ran analysis on the results. 
- Created a proforma test report.
- Completed stand up documentation with Daiki.
