Future of Debate Me - Development: https://github.com/deco3500-2017/SuzukiSwifts/blob/master/Future%20of%20Debate%20Me.docx

Stand Up 1:
Aims/Goals: 
Create low fidelity paper prototype of the user interface 
Create different versions of the options menu screen to see which is more appealing to users
Rating system screen
Online and inperson debate screens
Test after finishing designing
Develop a proforma test plan and questionnaire for users to test .
Create personas to identify our target audience.
Test our concept with users.


Progress: 
Created a low fidelity paper prototype for the apps user interface with a variation in designs. 
Created a proforma test plan with questions to ask users.
Created three personas.
Completed the value proposition canvas for each persona.
Conducted a questionnaire to test the concept of Debate Me.
Completed the project proposal. 

Issues/Changes: 
Some participants of the user test had stated that debating could possibly cause some conflicts and dislike each other, instead of becoming friends. Therefore, we added 'discussion' mode, where the users can friendlily discuss about the topic, instead of arguing against each other. 
Users were confused about the rating system. It was unclear what they were actually rating and therefore we decided to change this to a “Send a star” system where the users send a star only if they enjoyed debating with a matched partner. Number of stars received represent the level of that user in the app. 



Plan for next sprint: 
Run user tests:
Debating Concept
Menu screen
Rating system 	
Inperson debate (GPS navigation screen)
Online debate screen
Create digital prototype using marvel. 
Develop proforma test plan. 
Run user tests for the marvel prototype.
